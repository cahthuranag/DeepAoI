# DeepAoI
A Python 3.8 implementation of the System Model estimates the average AoI (AAoI) in a deep learning-aided multi-hop wireless communication system over the AWGN channels.
## Requirements

The implementation requires Python 3.8+ to run.
The following libraries are also required:

- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `pandas`
- `argparse`
- `itertools`
- `math`
- `scipy`
- `random`
- `tensorflow`
- `keras`

## How to install

### From PyPI

```
pip install 
```

### From source/GitHub

Directly using pip:

```
pip install 
```

Or each step at a time:

```
git clone  https://github.com/cahthuranag/DeepAoI.git
cd 
pip install .
```

### Installing for development and/or improving the package

```
git clone hhttps://github.com/cahthuranag/DeepAoI.git
cd 
pip install -e .[dev]
```

This way, the package is installed in development mode. As a result, the pytest dependencies/plugins are also installed.
